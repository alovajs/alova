## What is alova

alova is a lightweight request strategy library. It supports developers to use declarative way for various complex requests such as request sharing, paging requests, form submission, breakpoint resumption, etc., allowing developers to use little code to complete high availability and high fluency network interaction. This means that you no longer need to write the codes about request logic, and no longer need to maintain relevant data and states yourself. You only need to select and use the request useHook, alova will take over it for you. This will improve development efficiency, application operation efficiency, and reduces server pressure.

Learn more at the [alovajs website](https://alova.js.org), or try it out in [runnable examples](https://alova.js.org/category/examples).

## Reasons for choosing alova

Alova is also committed to solving the problem of client network requests, but unlike other request libraries, alova chooses the direction of business scenario request strategy, and it also provides rich Advanced Features.

- You may have been thinking about how to wrap `fetch` and `axios`. Now you no longer need to do this. alova complete complex requests with declarative style, such as request sharing, paging requests, form submissions, breakpoint uploads, etc, as well as automated cache management, request sharing, cross-component status update, etc.
- alova is lightweight, only 4kb+, which is 30%+ of axios.
- alova is low-coupling, you can make alova work with any UI framework in any js environment through different adapters (built-in supported UI framework is `vue/react/svelte`), and provides a unified experience and perfect code migration.
- alova can also achieve a highly aggregated organization of APIs. The request parameters, cache behavior, and response data transform of each API will be in the same code block, which has great advantages for managing a large number of APIs.
